Welcome to the ASRpy documentation.

ASR (Artefact Subspace Reconstruction) is a widely used automated cleaning
algorithm for EEG data. This version of ASR is implemented to easily
integrate with the MNE-Python toolbox for M/EEG analysis. The original method
was invented by Kothe & Jung (2016) for the EEGLab toolbox.

You find the documentation to all available functions by clicking on
the respective submodules.
